# cosim-benchmarks
Benchmark problems for co-simulation

This project contains benchmark problems to test co-simulation algorithms.

## Currently available examples

An implementation and description of the following examples is currently contained in this project. 

 - linearOscillator: A two-degree-of-freedom linear oscillator.

## Folder structure

The project contents are as distributed in the following folders:
 - ./doc: Latex source code to generate the documentation of each benchmark problem.
 - ./matlab: Matlab implementation of the examples. 
	- ./common: Library of functions
	- ./linearOscillator: 2-dof linear oscillator
 
Please read the README.md file inside each folder to find information about how to use the codes.

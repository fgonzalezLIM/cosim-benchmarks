  abstract  = {The formulation of a hydraulic actuator to be included in a general purpose finite element program for mechanism analysis is presented. 
The element takes into consideration all nonlinear effects to calculate the response, including Coulomb friction, variation of fluid properties with pressure and variation of certain geometrical characteristics with the elongation. 
At each time step, pressures at both chambers are computed by integrating in time the equations describing the hydrodynamics of the actuator. 
This integration is performed at the element level, uncoupled from the structural time integration.},
